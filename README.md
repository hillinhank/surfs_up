## Overview
### The purpose of this analysis was to provide an analysis of the temperature During the months of June and December. This analysis is pertinent to the success of an ice cream shop in a popular surfing hub. We used files containing weather data from a SQLite query to drive this analysis.
## Results
### Three main differences in weather data when comparing June and December:
#### * Difference 1: The mean temperatures during both the months of June and December are 74.9 and 71.0, respectively. This is a strong indicator that an ice cream shop in this surf town could be a great business idea! The mean indicates that during winter months it will remain warm enough to distribute cold treats. 
#### * Difference 2: The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, compared to 64 degrees in June. It stands to reason that these numbers are from late hours in the evening and are not likely to affect business.
#### * Difference 3: The standard deviation for both June and December approximately 3 degrees. Once again, this suggests that the local climate is stable and remains a potentially profitable business opportunity.
## Summary
#### Based on these results, surfing and ice cream in Hawaii seem to be a potentially profitable small business. During both the summer and winter months, this business can operate a full schedule without needing to close shop for climate related reasons i.e. foot-traffic, snow, or even temperatures below 50.
### Additional Queries
#### A query that may be beneficial to run would need to include precipitation data. Many tropical places have seasons of very high precipitation or even monsoons. This should absolutely be taken into account and examined prior to substantial capital investment.
#### A query that will be necesary to run is an  analysis of the effects of climate change on the island. It may not be wise to sink a large amount of money into a small business only to move and have to leave expensive equipment behind soon after..
